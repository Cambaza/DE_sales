# DE_sales
##Scenario:

E-commerce company wants to track real-time sales data from its platform and generate insights, such as:
- Top-selling products in the last hour
- Sales trends across different regions
- Average order value in real time
To achieve this, we need to build a real-time data pipeline that ingests, processes, and analyzes sales data.

1. *Project Goals*
- Build a real-time data pipeline to process sales transactions.
- Store processed data in a structured format for analytics.
- Enable visualization of sales trends using a dashboard.

2. *Data Sources & Pipeline Flow*
- Data Source: Simulated sales data generated in real time (use Python Faker to create mock transactions).
- Ingestion Layer: Use Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis to stream the data.
- Processing Layer: Process data in real-time using Apache Spark (Structured Streaming) or Apache Flink.
- Storage Layer: Store processed data in a database (PostgreSQL, Snowflake) or data warehouse (BigQuery, Redshift).
- Analytics & Visualization: Use Tableau, Power BI, or Metabase to create dashboards.

3. *Implementation Steps & Timeline*

   *Week 1-2: Set Up the Project*
   Install necessary tools: Kafka, Spark, PostgreSQL, and visualization tools.
   Write a Python script to simulate sales transactions and send them to Kafka.
   *Week 3-4: Data Ingestion & Streaming*
   Set up a Kafka producer to stream sales data.
   Create a Kafka consumer that reads sales data.
   *Week 5-6: Real-Time Data Processing*
   Use Apache Spark Structured Streaming to consume Kafka data.
   Apply transformations (e.g., calculate total sales per product).
   *Week 7-8: Data Storage*
   Store processed data in PostgreSQL or Snowflake.
   Optimize storage with indexing and partitioning.
   *Week 9-10: Visualization & Monitoring*
   Build dashboards in Metabase/Tableau to track real-time sales trends.
   Set up monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana.
   *Week 11-12: Deployment & Scaling*
   Deploy the pipeline on AWS/GCP using Docker and Kubernetes.
   Implement CI/CD for automated deployment.
